Equities gave up earlier gains that followed President Joe Biden’s decision to nominate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term as head of the U.S. central bank, as widely expected.   Need to know: Here’s why Santa may skip Wall Street this year Markets were mixed on Monday in thin trading ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving Day holiday, with the Nasdaq Composite Index \\n        COMP,\\n        +0.16%\\n       turning negative as the 10-year Treasury yield \\n        TMUBMUSD10Y,\\n        1.646%\\n       retook the 1.6% level.

Her appointment to vice chair offers Democrats a ballast to\\xa0Powell\\xa0and a likely regulatory win.” U.S. markets will be closed Thursday and see an abbreviated session Friday.

              "  ' Investment mogul and Shark Tank personality Kevin O’Leary isn’t shy about his fondness for cryptocurrencies. Most recently, he highlighted the ‘“real” opportunity when it comes to fueling the rise of Bitcoin over the long term: sovereign funds in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. “They have not allocated to crypto yet,” O’Leary said in an interview with Bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano. “When that happens, you’ll see it reflected in the price of Bitcoin. There’s no question about it.” O’Leary pegged the opportunity in the “billions and billions and billions” of dollars. That said, O’Leary’s biggest investment fund, O’Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, doesn’t invest in crypto at all — instead, it seeks businesses with strong profitability, balance sheets, and dividend growth. While Bitcoin is certainly becoming mainstream, it’s still important to maintain ample diversification with income-producing stocks. Let’s take a look at the top three holdings of O’Leary’s flagship fund. One (or all) of these dividend picks might be worth purchasing with your extra change. Home Depot isn’t nearly as exciting as crypto, but it’s the top holding at OUSA, accounting for 6% of the fund’s weight. The home improvement retail giant has around 2,300 stores, with each one averaging approximately 105,000 square feet of indoor retail space — a size that dwarfs most of its competitors. One thing that makes Home Depot stand out is how well it performed during the pandemic. Many brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled since the beginning of COVID-19. Yet Home Depot grew its sales nearly 20% in fiscal 2020 to $132.1 billion. It even boosted its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this year and now yields 1.6%. Shares aren’t cheap, though. After rallying more than 55% year to date, Home Depot trades at over $410 per share. But you can get a piece of the company using a popular stock trading app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.

There are just six weeks left in 2021 and the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) dipped nearly 20% off an all-time high set Nov. 10.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday. After May’s miserable sell-off, the demand for borrowing money to go long on crypto took a hit as well. Bitcoin perpetual swaps funding rates – that is, the cost of holding a levered long position in the most liquid offshore derivatives markets – stayed largely negative through the end of July. As prices began testing the $40,000 level at the end of July, funding rates began to tick up, and the market for perpetual swaps and futures grew. On Aug. 22, the combined open interest in bitcoin futures on BitMEX, Binance, Bybit, OKEx and Huobi broke above $10.4 billion, more than 50% higher than it was 90 days before, just after the May crash. Over the same period, the bitcoin spot price rose by about 30%. After the spot market peak of $68,990.90 on Nov. 10 (per the XBX), prices fell and the funding rate plunged. Open interest did not. Between Nov. 10 and Nov. 18, aggregate open interest on bitcoin perp swaps and futures fell from $24.9 billion to $22.8 billion, according to Skew – about 8%, far less than the spot-market price drop over the same period. Compare that to the September dip (another drop of around 20% in the spot price). At that time, open interest fell 33% between the local high on Sept. 6 and the bottom on Sept. 27. So it could be that the latest decline in bitcoin prices may be due not to deleveraging so much as just a lack of demand for',\n",

              "  \" Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down by more than 2.5% on Monday morning, trading at $57,622 (£42,840). The fall comes as the president of El Salvador announced plans to build a 'bitcoin city' in the country at a promotional Bitcoin event in the coastal town of Mizata late on Saturday. President Nayib Bukele said the city will be circular to mimic the shape of a large coin, and will be built at the base of Conchagua volcano in order to harness its geothermal energy to power bitcoin mining as well as supply energy to the city.\\xa0 The construction and infrastructure of the city will be financed partly by an issue of $1bn in sovereign bonds backed by the cryptocurrency, Bukele said. The city will have no property, income or capital gains taxes, with costs covered by a sales tax and money raised by the bond issues. Bukele estimated that the construction of the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 bitcoins. The bonds will be issued in 2022 and the construction of the city will begin 60 days later, according to the government.

He said the bonds will be US dollar-denominated 10-year bonds, with half the funds converted to bitcoin and the other half used for infrastructure and bitcoin mining. In September, El Salvador became the first country in the world to introduce bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the US dollar. The government launched a digital wallet known as the Chivo wallet and offered $30 worth of bitcoin to people who downloaded it. More than 200 new cash machines were also installed across the country and businesses were compelled to accept the cryptocurrency as payment, wherever possible. The move was presented as a way to boost economic development and jobs, but sparked protests across the country where 32.7% of the population remain below the poverty line and only 58% have access to the internet, which is necessary for bitcoin\",\n",

The Central American country’s debt has been among the world’s worst performers so far this week as investors consider whether President Nayib Bukele’s plan to sell sovereign Bitcoin bonds closes the door on a deal with the International Monetary Fund. El Salvador’s progress with the IMF has soured since May, when Bukele’s party took over the assembly and fired five top judges and the attorney general. His policies, including the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, have been repeatedly criticized by the multilateral lender. “This announcement cements the ‘anything-but-the-IMF’ path,” said Nathalie Marshik, a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. managing director. Bonds are falling “as the market reassesses possible recovery value lower on unpredictability of policies.” The nation’s debt is trading in distressed territory, with investors now demanding 1,202 basis points in extra yield to hold El Salvador’s dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. data. While the plan to sell new, tokenized bonds could offer the government some breathing room, it also adds to uncertainties and potential risks.

To some market-watchers, that’s no coincidence. The 100-day correlation coefficient of Bitcoin and the S&P 500 stands at 0.33, among the highest readings of the year. That means that when stocks move up, Bitcoin is likely to do the same, and vice versa. (A coefficient of 1 means the assets are moving in lockstep, while minus-1 would show they’re moving in opposite directions.) “The recent drawdown in Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem has been tied to the selloff in the more risky growth names,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone. “So you’re seeing cryptocurrencies come off and you’re seeing the high-flying growth names come down.” Crypto proponents have long argued that Bitcoin and other digital assets, on account of their being an idiosyncratic asset class, could act as hedges against wild swings in other areas of the financial market. That proposition is currently being tested as more speculative areas of the market come under pressure amid expectations interest rates could climb higher much sooner than previously expected.

              "  'The Game Boy Advance is useful in the modern era for more than watching Christopher Nolan blockbusters. Gizmodo notes that tinkerer Rodrigo Alfonso has Nintendo\\'s 20-year-old handheld running PlayStation (and Genesis, and SNES) games without special modifications. The trick, as you might imagine revolves around a custom cartridge — you\\'re technically running the game on a separate system. The cartridge houses a Raspberry Pi 3 mini-computer running the RetroPie emulator and streaming both video and input through the GBA\\'s multiplayer-oriented Link Port. Yes, that\\'s constraining as you think it is — you can\\'t transfer more than 1.6Mbps bi-directionally, and the Pi has to routinely give the \"poor\" GBA\\'s processor a break for a few microseconds. Alfonso suggests lowering the stream resolution from the console\\'s native 240 x 160 if a high frame rate is important. Still, the results are mostly impressive. The special cart can handle classics like the Crash Bandicoot series and Spyro the Dragon at smooth frame rates, albeit with some video artifacts that reflect the limited bandwidth. You can overclock the GBA\\'s processor to improve the frame rate and quality. You\\'ll have to build the cartridge and load code yourself, although Alfonso has helpfully provided both on GitHub. This probably won\\'t replace a PSP if you want the most authentic PlayStation handheld experience you can get. It might, however, give you a reason to dig your GBA out of the closet.

It’s also almost 10x more than it was trading for a few months before that. Source: Emil O / Shutterstock.com For a retailer, the valuation is ridiculous. It’s a market cap of $13.3 billion for a company that may have sales of $5.5 billion in 2021. Most retailers sell at a discount to sales because margins are so thin. As to margins, at GameStop there are none. The company is expected to lose about $1 per share this year. Its single analyst at Tipranks still wants you to sell it, with a price target of $50.

There’s a credit card and a trade-in marketplace. But players aren’t playing on the site, and there’s no indication from the company of when that might happen. The problem for GameStop all along has been that gaming is changing, and GameStop isn’t changing with it. The new game involves heavy use of cloud resources, like Amazon’s Twitch.

              "  'New weekly claims fall to 199,000, far less than the expected 260,000 Linnet Chinese offers authentic and culturally relevant learning experiences SINGAPORE, Nov. 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The South Korean Netflix show Squid Game has smashed the Internet with its overwhelming popularity. It is surprising to see the global obsession with this show, especially given the minimal English dialogue and its relatively foreign culture to the mainstream audience. However, amidst the hype, some critics have pointed out that the English translation has failed to preserve the original meanings. This problem brings up an important aspect of language learning: cultural contextualization. Knowing the meanings of the words is only the first step to learning a language. More importantly, it is about understanding the cultural nuances embedded within the dialogues. In the current language learning landscape, there are some common criticisms: 1) lack of authentic learning environments, 2) limited meaningful feedback, and 3) lack of cultural contexts. Under these circumstances, it is hard for learners to learn a new language if they do not fully understand the cultural and linguistic roots. Luckily, aside from the decontextualized language learning apps on the market, there are other options to choose from. Linnet Chinese is a Chinese learning platform developed by engineers from Silicon Valley. It aims at offering the most authentic and culturally relevant learning experience to children who want to learn the language and the culture. Chinese culture and real-life scenarios are embedded throughout the learning process, helping learners to capture the cultural nuances behind each vocabulary and sentence. Linnet Chinese prides itself on the hybrid format of live and AI classes. It attempts to address the most important problems of language learning by incorporating interactivity, formative assessment, and gamification into its design. With the hybrid format, not only can you receive feedback from live teachers who seamlessly track your learning progress with the support of learning data, but you can also take the AI classes at your own time, creating a personalized learning schedule that fits your unique needs. The subscription-based AI class employs a learner-centric design and is embraced by users',\n",

Reviving Netflix's original-content strategy, while opening up strategic new markets, the success of Squid Game will help the streaming giant land new customers and ink new deals. Netflix's original content is more important to its success than ever, as traditional content giants like Disney and Paramount take back the rights to their hot properties to headline their own fledgling streaming services.

In the first half of the year, it reported its slowest pace of subscriber additions since 2013, and blamed the dearth of new hit shows for some of its struggles.\\xa0 It experienced a mixed Q2, losing subscribers in the US and Canada, while missing its estimated earnings per share, all while its rivals thrived. The South Korean smash hit has been watched by more than 111 million households around the world, to surpass Bridgerton as Netflix's most popular new series ever. Squid Game is so popular that a South Korean internet provider sued Netflix, claiming the show caused a surge in traffic, which increased their maintenance costs. For Netflix, the entire season of Squid Game only cost US$21 million to produce – less than some series spend on a single episode. That investment is now estimated to be worth around US$900 million. Netflix stock is up 16 per cent in Q3 2021, in part thanks to the runaway success of Squid Game, but its real value is the long-term opportunities it has created.

Flickr The same catalysts mentioned on the SEC report that provided clarity on GME’s trading activity in January 2021 could be at play here once again. The SEC report released in October shed light on GME trading activity in January 2021. The driving forces behind the stock having skyrocketed to a high of around $350 per share in Q1 included (1) frequent Reddit mentions, (2) significant coverage on mainstream media, (3) large volume changes and, to a lesser extent, (4) elevated short interest. The “ape thesis” on stock market irregularities did not go unnoticed by the SEC. The agency mentioned that it is still identifying “areas of market structure and regulatory framework for potential study and additional consideration”. These include (1) forces that may cause a brokerage firm to restrict trading; (2) digital engagement practices and PFOF, i.e. payment for order flow; (3) dark pool trading; and (4) the market dynamics of short selling. GameStop stock is back as having the most Reddit mentions (see below). Popularity online tends to increase media coverage, and both factors have been highlighted by the SEC as major catalysts for GME stock having surged in January.

It could possibly also be used to detect and fix serious issues more quickly. FSD 10.3 was released more widely than previous betas, but it was quickly pulled back due to issues like unwarranted Forward Collision Warnings, unexpected autobraking and more.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, Dillard’s, Inc. DDS, and Tesla, Inc. TSLA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: NVIDIA has been a rocket in the past month -- up over 40% since October 25 -- even before two events which sent it higher still. The two events were (1) its annual GPU Tech Conference on November 9, which is always full of great surprises from Jensen Huang and his teams of engineering wizards; and (2) its Q3 beat-and-raise earnings report last Wednesday. I wrote and talked about the first event here... NVIDIA GTC Lessons in 2 Minutes from Professor Huang In the video, I share a 2-minute clip from Jensen\\'s keynote where he summarizes multiple factors driving the success of the NVIDIA hardware-software stack known as CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).

The sales were carried out to cover taxes related to Musk exercising an additional 2.15 million stock options, the documents show. With the most recent disposals, Musk now has sold 9.2 million shares worth about $9.9 billion since he conducted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla holding. A chunk of that money will go to taxes. To reach the 10% threshold, Musk would need to sell some 17 million shares, or about 1.7% of the company’s outstanding stock. If his exercisable options are factored into his overall ownership, he’ll need to sell even more. Since the Twitter poll, Musk has exercised millions of options that were less than a year from their expiration date. In September, he established a pre-arranged trading plan to carry out “an orderly sale of shares related to the exercise of stock options,” filings show. Musk didn’t mention the existence of that plan in his tweets early this month. Tesla shares fell 3.5% to $1,070.25 at 9:43 a.m. in New York. The stock has traded down about 12% since Musk’s poll.

So says Morgan Stanley.

The $10 trillion global mobility market is up for grabs and if Apple enters the space, it could be a “clear negative” for carmakers such as, Ford Motor Co. and Tesla Inc., Morgan Stanley autos analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note. Apple shares rose nearly 3% to a fresh all-time high on Thursday, wrestling back its crown as the world’s most-valuable listed company from Microsoft Corp. The stock extended gains on Friday, rising as much as 0.7%. Even if the firm were to take just a 4% share of the global mobility market, Morgan Stanley sees its revenue base doubling as a result. And there’s more: If cars can drive themselves, people could use time otherwise spent at the wheel on their iPhones. Apple’s entry to any industry has regularly proved to be a catalyst in scaling up new technologies. Be it smartphones, tablets or smartwatches, the company’s product launches almost always lead to an expansion of the relevant market, and to Apple taking a significant share of it. “Our experience suggests an even greater bias to the upside on autonomous vehicles adoption within a few years of an Apple Car launch,” Morgan Stanley technology analyst Katy Huberty wrote in a separate note.
